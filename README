Introduction
------------

QPA is designed as a GAP 4.4 share package providing new functions in
noncommutative algebra. Currently QPA provides the following features:

    - Path algebras and their quotients
    - Matrix representations of path algebras and their quotients
    - Connection to GBNP for computing Groebner bases (only with length-lex ordering)
    - Projective modules over path algebras
    - Modules over path algebras defined by projective presentations
    - Endomorphism rings and homomorphism spaces of modules over path algebras
    - Decomposition of finite modules over path algebras

--------

The following should be included with this version of QPA.

    README   - this file

    noweb    - Noweb literate program for QPA (don't use!)

Obtaining
---------

QPA can be obtained from 

    	http://sourceforge.net/projects/quiverspathalg/

To use the GBNP Groebner basis system, obtain GBNP from its home at:

	http://www.win.tue.nl/~amc/pub/grobner/chap0.html

Installation
------------

The easiest installation is to place QPA-0.4.3.tar.gz in the `pkg'
directory of your GAP installation. Assuming ${GAPDIR} is the location
of your GAP installation, the following steps will unpack QPA-0.4.3.tar.gz

        cd ${GAPDIR}/pkg
        gunzip QPA-0.4.3.tar.gz
        tar xf QPA-0.4.3.tar.gz

A directory named `QPA' should now exist in ${GAPDIR}/pkg.  It is assumed
that the GBNP package (0.9.3 or higher) is installed in the ${GAPDIR}/pkg
directory also.


Using QPA
----------

The QPA share package can be loaded in GAP with

        RequirePackage("QPA");

See the user manual in the doc directory for more information regarding
the use of QPA.
