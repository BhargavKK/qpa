Introduction
------------

The "Quivers and Path Algebras" team has as a goal to develop a GAP
package(s) for carrying out computations for finite dimensional
quotients of path algebras over the fields that are available in
GAP. The package we aim to develop for GAP is called QPA for Quivers
and Path Algebras.

QPA is designed as a GAP 4.4 share package providing new functions in
noncommutative algebra. For the current functions provided by QPA follow
the URL
              http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/

and look at WhatYouCanDoList.

Obtaining
---------

QPA can be obtained from 

    	http://sourceforge.net/projects/quiverspathalg/

The Groebner basis package GBNP is required to run QPA. The
GBNP Groebner basis can be obtain from its home at:

	http://www.win.tue.nl/~amc/pub/grobner/chap0.html

The GAPDoc package is necessary for generating the documentation
files. The GAPDoc package can be obtain from its home at:

  http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/index.html

Installation
------------

For intalling and downloading: Assuming that GAP is installed on your
comupter, follow the following steps:

1.  Make a directory, say GAPdirectory.
2.  In the GAPdirectory, create a subdirectory gap, with again a 
    subdirectory pkg, that is, now you should have a directory 
    GAPdirectory/gap/pkg/.
3.  Move to the directory GAPdirectory/gap/pkg/
4.  Give the following command:
        git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/quiverspathalg/qpa qpa
5.  QPA is using the GAP-package GBNP, go to this webpage and 
    download the latest version of this package. Unpack it in 
    the directory GAPdirectory/gap/pkg/.
6.  The directory GAPdirectory/gap/pkg/ should now have two subdirectories, gbnp and qpa.
7.  When starting GAP, use the command: gap -l ";/fullpath/GAPdirectory/gap/", 
    where "fullpath" is the complete directory path name for the directory 
    containing the subdirectory GAPdirectory. Or for convenience, define an 
    alias, for instance in .bashrc, alias gap='gap -l ";/fullpath/GAPdirectory/gap/"'.
8.  Making the documentation (install GAPDoc 1.3 for GAP 4.4.12, GAPDoc 1.5 for GAP > 4.4):
    (i)   Move to the directory GAPdirectory/gap/pkg/qpa/doc
    (ii)  Give the command: gap MakeQPADoc.gi (see below for setting up the gap command).

For the latest version of QPA, always download the GIT repository. 
Follow the instructions in 3 and 4 above to update your installation, 
if you have a version of QPA installed already in GAPdirectory/gap/pkg/.

Using QPA
----------

Assuming that GAP is installed on your computer and that QPA is installed as
above, start QPA/GAP using the command: 

     gap -l ";/fullpath/GAPdirectory/gap/" 

where "fullpath" is the complete directory path name for the directory
containing the subdirectory GAPdirectory. Or for convenience, define
an alias, for instance in .bashrc, 

     alias gap='gap -l ";/fullpath/GAPdirectory/gap/"'  

See the user manual in the doc directory for more information regarding
the use of QPA, or follow the URL

     http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/manual.pdf

to see the current manual/documentation of QPA (still work in progress,
not brilliant at this point).
